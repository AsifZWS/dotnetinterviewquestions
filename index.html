          1. What are the different types of classes in programming?
        </h2>
        <div id="classTypes" class="content">
          <h3>Abstract Class:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> Can you create an object of an abstract
              class?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> No, you cannot create an object of an abstract
              class. You need to inherit from an abstract class to use it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What types of methods can an abstract class
              contain?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> An abstract class can contain both abstract
              and non-abstract methods. Abstract methods are declared with the
              <code>abstract</code> keyword, unlike interface methods.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Static Class:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> Can you create an object of a static class?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> No, you cannot create an object of a static
              class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> Can a static class be inherited?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> No, a static class cannot be inherited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What can a static class contain?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A static class can only contain static members
              (variables and methods), and these members must be declared with
              the <code>static</code> keyword.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Sealed Class:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> Can you create an object of a sealed class?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can create an object of a sealed
              class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> Can you inherit from a sealed class?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> No, you cannot inherit from a sealed class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What members can a sealed class have?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A sealed class can have normal members.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Partial Class:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What does the <code>partial</code> keyword do
              for a class?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The <code>partial</code> keyword allows a
              class to be split across multiple files. At runtime, all partial
              class files are merged into a single class. This is useful for
              collaborative work on a single class with different
              functionalities.

        <h2 onclick="toggleContent('constructors')">
          2. What are the different types of constructors in programming?
        </h2>
        <div id="constructors" class="content">
          <h3>Default Constructor:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is a default constructor?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A default constructor is a constructor without
              any parameters. It is automatically created if you do not define
              any constructors in the class.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Parameterized Constructor:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is a parameterized constructor?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A parameterized constructor is one that takes
              parameters. You can have multiple parameterized constructors in a
              class, provided they have different parameter lists (constructor
              overloading).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Static Constructor:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> When is a static constructor called?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A static constructor is called automatically
              when a class is first accessed. It executes only once.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What are the restrictions for a static
              constructor?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A static constructor cannot have access
              modifiers or parameters and can only access static members of the
              class.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Private Constructor:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the purpose of a private
              constructor?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A private constructor prevents the creation of
              objects from outside the class. It is often used in classes that
              contain only static members or in the Singleton design pattern.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Copy Constructor:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is a copy constructor?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A copy constructor is a constructor that
              creates a new object by copying the variables from an existing
              object.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Example:</strong><br />
              <code>
                Employee emp = new Employee();<br />
                Employee emp1 = new Employee(emp);
              </code>

          3. What are extension methods in programming?
        </h2>
        <div id="extensionMethods" class="content">
          <h3>Extension Methods:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is an extension method?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> An extension method is a static method defined
              in a static class where the <code>this</code> modifier is applied
              to the first parameter. The type of this first parameter is the
              type being extended. For example, if you want to add a new method
              to the <code>string</code> type, you would create an extension
              method so that you can call it as if it were a native method like
              <code>str.ToString()</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> How do you use extension methods?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Extension methods are only available when you
              explicitly import the namespace containing the static class with
              the extension methods into your source code using a
              <code>using</code> directive.

          <h3>Boxing and Unboxing:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is boxing?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Boxing is the process of converting a value
              type to a reference type.<br />
              <strong>Example:</strong><br />
              <code>
                int num2 = 123;<br />
                object num1 = num2; // num1 is now a reference type holding the
                value of num2
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is unboxing?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Unboxing is the process of converting a
              reference type back to a value type.<br />
              <strong>Example:</strong><br />
              <code>
                object num1 = 123;<br />
                int num2 = (int) num1; // num2 is now a value type holding the
                value of num1
              </code>

          dependencies differ?
        </h2>
        <div id="dependencyInjection" class="content">
          <h3>Dependency Injection (DI):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is Dependency Injection?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern
              used to achieve loose coupling between components by injecting
              dependencies rather than having components create them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is a transient dependency?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A transient dependency creates a new instance
              of the object each time it is requested. For example, if
              <code>MyClass</code> needs an instance of
              <code>SomeDependency</code>, it gets one, and if
              <code>SomeOtherClass</code> needs an instance, it gets a
              different, new instance of <code>SomeDependency</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is a scoped dependency?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> A scoped dependency ensures that the same
              instance of the object is used throughout a single request. In the
              context of HTTP requests, if <code>MyClass</code> and
              <code>SomeOtherClass</code> both need an instance of
              <code>SomeDependency</code>, they will receive the same instance
              for the duration of that HTTP request.

        </h2>
        <div id="middleware" class="content">
          <h3>Middleware in ASP.NET:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is middleware?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Middleware is a pipeline component that sits
              between the HTTP request and response. It allows you to insert
              code for tasks such as authentication and logging in between the
              incoming request and outgoing response. Examples include
              <code>app.UseRouting</code>, <code>app.UseAuthorization</code>,
              and <code>app.UseEndpoints</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the purpose of
              <code>app.Run()</code> method in middleware?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The <code>app.Run()</code> method adds a
              terminal middleware to the end of the pipeline. It typically does
              not call the next middleware component and is used to terminate
              the pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> How does <code>app.Use()</code> method differ
              from <code>app.Run()</code>?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The <code>app.Use()</code> method configures
              middleware components and can call the next middleware in the
              pipeline. Unlike <code>app.Run()</code>,
              <code>app.Use()</code> can be used to chain multiple middleware
              components and can short-circuit the pipeline by not calling the
              next middleware.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the <code>app.Map()</code> method used
              for?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The <code>app.Map()</code> method is used to
              branch the request pipeline based on request path matches. It
              allows you to conditionally execute a branch of middleware if the
              request path starts with the specified path.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What are the characteristics of middleware?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Middleware has access to both the incoming request and the
                  outgoing response.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It can pass the request to the next piece of middleware in the
                  pipeline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It can perform processing logic before passing the request to
                  the next middleware.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It can terminate (short-circuit) the request pipeline if
                  needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Middleware is executed in the order it is added to the

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is managed code?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Managed code runs under the control of the
              Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET environment. It benefits
              from features such as garbage collection and exception handling
              provided by the CLR.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is unmanaged code?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Unmanaged code runs directly on the operating
              system without the CLR. It is typically compiled into machine code
              (e.g., executable files) and does not have the additional services
              provided by the CLR.

          <h3>Garbage Collection and Disposal:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is garbage collection?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Garbage collection in .NET is a process
              managed by the CLR that automatically frees up memory by deleting
              objects that are no longer in use. It helps prevent memory leaks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the `Finalize` method?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The `Finalize` method is a special method in
              .NET that is called by the garbage collector to clean up unmanaged
              resources before an object is reclaimed. It is automatically
              invoked by the garbage collector and cannot be called explicitly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the `Dispose` method?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The `Dispose` method is used to explicitly
              release unmanaged resources when they are no longer needed. To
              implement `Dispose`, a class should implement the `IDisposable`
              interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the `IDisposable` interface?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The `IDisposable` interface defines the
              `Dispose` method, which classes can implement to provide a way to
              release unmanaged resources manually.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is the `string` type?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The `string` type is immutable, meaning its
              value cannot be changed once assigned. Every modification results
              in the creation of a new `string` instance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is `StringBuilder`?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> `StringBuilder` is a mutable type designed for
              scenarios where the string value changes frequently. It is more
              efficient for such cases because it avoids creating multiple
              string instances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> When should you use `StringBuilder` over
              `string`?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Use `StringBuilder` when you expect to perform
              frequent modifications to a string value throughout the
              application lifecycle. It is more efficient in such cases compared
              to repeatedly modifying `string` instances.

              <strong>Q:</strong> What does `==` do in object comparison?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The `==` operator compares object references,
              meaning it checks if two references point to the same object in
              memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What does the `Equals` method do?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> The `Equals` method compares the actual values
              of the objects, assuming it is overridden in the object's class to
              provide value-based comparison.

              <strong>Q:</strong> What is late binding?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Late binding refers to the process where the
              type of an object and its methods or properties are determined at
              runtime. It is used with dynamic objects where the type
              information is not known at compile time.

            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is early binding?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Early binding refers to the process where the
              type of an object and its methods or properties are known at
              compile time. The compiler checks for type correctness before
              runtime.

              <strong>Q:</strong> What is `IQueryable`?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> `IQueryable` is best suited for querying data
              from a database. It allows for constructing queries that are
              translated to SQL and executed on the database server, providing
              efficient data retrieval.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is `IEnumerable`?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> `IEnumerable` is best for querying in-memory
              collections. It supports iteration over collections but does not
              provide query translation to SQL or other query optimizations.

              <strong>Q:</strong> What is an `Array`?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> An `Array` is a strongly-typed collection
              where all elements must be of the same data type. It is fast and
              efficient in terms of performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What is an `ArrayList`?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> An `ArrayList` is a non-generic collection
              that can hold elements of different data types. It is slower and
              less efficient compared to `Array` due to its lack of type safety

                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is an interface in programming?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> An interface is a contract that defines a set of abstract methods (without implementations) that implementing classes must provide. It is used to achieve abstraction and supports multiple inheritance.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What are the benefits of using interfaces?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong>  
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Interfaces provide a way to define methods without specifying how they are implemented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Inheritance</strong>: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for flexible designs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decoupling</strong>: Interfaces allow different parts of a program to interact without knowing the specific implementations.</li>

            <h3>C# Keywords:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What does the `virtual` keyword do?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> The `virtual` keyword allows a method in a base class to be overridden in derived classes. It indicates that the method can be redefined in any subclass.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the purpose of the `ref` keyword?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> The `ref` keyword is used to pass arguments by reference to a method. Changes to the parameter in the method will reflect back to the original variable in the calling method. The `ref` parameter must be initialized before being passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> How does the `out` keyword differ from `ref`?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> The `out` keyword is used to pass arguments to methods as reference types, typically when a method needs to return multiple values. Unlike `ref`, `out` parameters do not need to be initialized before being passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What does the `yield` keyword do?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> The `yield` keyword is used in an iterator method to return elements one at a time, allowing for deferred execution and lazy evaluation. It simplifies the implementation of custom iterators.</li>

                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality without changing existing code.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Objects of a derived class should be replaceable with objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead, use multiple, smaller interfaces.</li>

                    <strong>A:</strong> Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide templates for solving specific issues in object-oriented design.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> Why should we use design patterns?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Design patterns help improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability. They offer well-tested solutions and best practices that can be applied to various design problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Repository pattern?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> The Repository pattern provides an abstraction layer between the data access logic and the business logic. It allows for easy management and querying of data, and supports separation of concerns.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Unit Of Work pattern?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> The Unit Of Work pattern manages a set of operations that can be committed or rolled back as a single transaction. It helps ensure data consistency and manage transactional work.</li>

            <h3>Collections, Thread Safety, and Generics:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What are collections in .NET?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Collections are data structures that store groups of related objects. Examples include arrays, lists, and dictionaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What does thread safety mean in the context of collections?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Thread safety ensures that a collection can be safely used by multiple threads simultaneously without causing data corruption or inconsistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> What are generics and why are they beneficial?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Generics allow for the creation of classes, methods, and interfaces that operate on any data type while maintaining type safety. They are beneficial because they reduce code duplication, improve performance, and provide compile-time type checking.</li>
                <li><strong>Q:</strong> Which is faster: using generics or non-generic collections?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> Generics are generally faster than non-generic collections because they avoid the overhead of type casting and boxing/unboxing, leading to better performance and type safety.</li>
